/// An event sink.
///
/// This primitive is a way of generating streams of events. One can send
/// input values into a sink and generate a stream that fires all these inputs
/// as events:
///
/// ```
/// # use carboxyl::Sink;
/// // A new sink
/// let sink = Sink::new();
///
/// // Make an iterator over a stream.
/// let mut events = sink.stream().events();
///
/// // Send a value into the sink
/// sink.send(5);
///
/// // The stream
/// assert_eq!(events.next(), Some(5));
/// ```
///
/// You can also feed a sink with an iterator:
///
/// ```
/// # use carboxyl::Sink;
/// # let sink = Sink::new();
/// # let mut events = sink.stream().events();
/// sink.feed(20..40);
/// assert_eq!(events.take(4).collect::<Vec<_>>(), vec![20, 21, 22, 23]);
/// ```
///
/// # Asynchronous calls
///
/// It is possible to send events into the sink asynchronously using the methods
/// `send_async` and `feed_async`. Note though, that this will void some
/// guarantees on the order of events. In the following example, it is unclear,
/// which event is the first in the stream:
///
/// ```
/// # use carboxyl::Sink;
/// let sink = Sink::new();
/// let mut events = sink.stream().events();
/// sink.send_async(13);
/// sink.send_async(22);
/// let first = events.next().unwrap();
/// assert!(first == 13 || first == 22);
/// ```
///
/// `feed_async` provides a workaround, as it preserves the order of events from
/// the iterator. However, any event sent into the sink after a call to it, may
/// come at any point between the iterator events.
